Feature: I want to test Kayak flight search functionality


  Scenario Outline: Kayak domestic flight search
    Given I am on Kayak home page
    When I perform flight search for <city>
    And from date should be <fromDate>
    And to date should be <todate>
    And I click on search button
    Then Flight search result page should be displayed and the prices should be displayed in increasing order
    
    Examples: 
    
    | city 		| 		fromDate 					| todate 	  		 |
    | Mumbai 	| 26 May, 2024			    | 27 May, 2024   |
    | Pune 		| 27 June, 2024 			  | 29 June, 2024  |
